I am Alejandro Chavez a running start student at pierce college i am a junior in highschool. I participate in school sports the sports are varsity football and varsity soccer for football i am the kicker. for soccer i am the foward centermid and outside midfielder. i have my own landscaping business i am very ambitious i want to have a huge company i think i am capable of this because in little amount of time ive been able to get many customers.
i thought techincal writing was writing using technology. i didnt know what the hell to expect from this class this class is very dsifferent then what i thought it would have been now i know we make instructions much simpler then they should be so many different types of people can understand how to use a certain product or prorgram 
the programing historian facilitates how to find complex or simple information and gives us the understanding to be able to teach those who need instruction. the audience for programing historian is for those who want to become technical writers. pierce hacker is for those who want to begin to program or begin to technical write. and can also look at other peoples work for ideas.
this text looks like something you would read for instructions or give out instructions it has a very proffesional outlook with very good organization having settings near profile and then has a section for each different thing you want to do like issues or projects or even pull requests.
this week ive learned many things i learned how github works what technical writing in general is! and how it works. i learned how to do my first instructions paper as well.


# week2
this week in class we made instructions for our lego creations i created my instructions online. i chose to add pictures to my instrctions so i could be as precise as possible. i want the person reading my instructions to know exactly what it is i want them to do with the lego pieces. 
my intention is for kids to read my instructions in class it is going to be students but my main target is kids because what kind of kids dont like race cars and legos? they've been able to make my writing simpler.
i chose google docs because it is quick easy accesible and professional. it just shows id rather write on a plat form im used to.
this week i learned that i personally enjoy technical writing i didnt think it would be fun but writing steps to how to do something really isnt that difficult. it is very enjoyable and easy.
feed back that i recieved is i should keep adding in progress pictures to the steps mainly step 6 and 7 because my classmate didnt understand where i wanted the dome and the 2x6 lego piece to go. but overall he felt it was fairly easy
this is my link to my instrctuins piece
